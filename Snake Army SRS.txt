1.	Introduction

1.1	Purpose
	The purpose of this project is to better understand how to use the Waterfall process by creating a Chess game as a team project. 
	<Identify the product whose software requirements are specified in this document, including the revision or release number. 
	Describe the scope of the product that is covered by this SRS, particularly if this SRS describes only part of the system or a 		single subsystem.>
	
1.2 	Document conventions
	To maintain order, keep every section of text separated by a space.

1.3	Intended Audience and Reading Suggestions
	<Describe the different types of reader that the document is intended for, such as developers, project managers, marketing 		staff, users, testers, and documentation writers. Describe what the rest of this SRS contains and how it is organized. Suggest a 	 sequence for reading the document, beginning with the overview sections and proceeding through the sections that are most 		pertinent to each reader type.>

1.4	Product Scope
	<Provide a short description of the software being specified and its purpose, including relevant benefits, objectives, and 		goals. Relate the software to corporate goals or business strategies. If a separate vision and scope document is available, 		refer to it rather than duplicating its contents here.>

1.5	References
	http://www.chessvariants.com/d.chess/chess.html
	<List any other documents or Web addresses to which this SRS refers. These may include user interface style guides, contracts, 		standards, system requirements specifications, use case documents, or a vision and scope document. Provide enough information so 	 that the reader could access a copy of each reference, including title, author, version number, date, and source or location.>


1. The software shall have a user interface (ASCII text is fine, sprites, html images, etc.).
	* To be discussed and determined as a team.
		//Team discussion so far -> Java
	
2. The software shall have at least ONE form of AI implementation.
	* Discussion on expectation needed.
		
3. The software shall be user input driven.
	* Discussion needed as this needs to be compatible with #1.
		
4. The software shall begin from the normal starting position.
	* Default positions can be found here: http://www.chessvariants.com/d.chess/chess.html
	* More specifics can be added to increase the document size.
	* The game begins with the white pieces moving first and the black pieces second.
	
5. The software shall be able to allow only one move per turn.

6. The software shall be able to determine a check mate and end the game.
	* When a player is in check, and he cannot make a move such that after the move, the king is not in check, then he is mated.
	
7. Each piece shall move and attack only in their legal ways.
	a) Rook
		* The rook attacks in the same way it moves. 
		* The rook moves in a straight line, horizontally or vertically in the + direction. 
		* The rook shall not jump over other pieces, that is: all squares between the square where the rook starts its move and 		  where the rook ends its move must be empty. 
		* Rooks shall be worth 5 points.
	b) Bishop	
		* The bishop attacks in the same way it moves. 
		* The bishop moves in a straight diagonal line, in the X direction. 
		* The bishop shall also not jump over other pieces.
		* The bishop shall be worth 3 points.
	c) Queen	
		* The queen attacks in the same way it moves.
		* The queen has the combined moves of the rook and the bishop, i.e., the queen may move in any straight line, 				  horizontal, vertical, or diagonal.
		* The queen shall also not jump over other pieces.
		* The queen shall be worth 9 points. 
	d) Knight
		* The knight makes a move that consists of first one step in a horizontal or vertical direction, and then one step 			  diagonally in an outward direction. 
		* The knight jumps: it is allowed that the first square that the knight passes over is occupied by an arbitrary piece. 	  		    For instance, white can start the game by moving his knight, jumping over a pawn. The piece that is jumped over is 			  further not affected by the knight: as usual, a knight takes a piece of the opponent by moving to the square that 			  contains that piece.
		* Knights shall be worth 3 points.
	e) Pawn
		* When a pawn has not moved at all, the pawn may choose to move one square forward, or two squares forward. Otherwise it 		   shall only move one square directly forward.
		* Pawns shall only attack diagonally forward.
		* The pawn shall choose between attacking and moving.
		* If a pawn makes it to the opposing side of the chess board, it shall be promoted to any piece of choice.
		* Pawns shall be worth 1 point. 
	f) King
		* The king shall move one square in any direction, so long as it does not put him under attack.
		* If the king has not moved, nor the rook, it shall have the opportunity to “castle” itself.


8. The square where any piece ends their move shall not contain a piece of the same color.

9. All pieces, when the square where their attack ends contains a piece of the opponent, then the opponent’s piece is taken. 
	* Taken pieces are removed from the board, and out of play for the rest of the game. (Taking is not compulsory.)
	* Pieces that are captured shall be visible in a display on the right side of the game board. 
	
10. Each piece shall move in a contained area (the board) and shall not move off the board under any circumstances (including claiming a     piece of the opposite color).

11. Each turn (Excluding AI), the player(s) shall be granted an option of forfeiting the match if they wish to do so.

12. Each time a player (Including AI) moves a piece, the game shall not allow the opposing player to make a move until the previous 	     piece is moved on the board.

13. The spaces on the chess board shall be labeled on an XY axis where the origin begins at the bottom-left corner. 
	* The Y axis shall be labeled 1-8 starting from the origin.
	* The X axis shall be labeled a-h starting from the origin.
